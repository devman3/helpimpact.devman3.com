Community foundations are public charities established in communities throughout the world to support community efforts. Frequently, these community foundations have both funds to be used at the discretion of the board of directors and other, specialized funds established by individuals, families, businesses, and nonprofit groups at these foundations into which they contribute a variety of assets (cash and stock being among the most popular). These assets are invested and grow over time. While there are many different kinds of funds that can be established, among the most popular are donor advised funds. These enable those who established them to contribute assets into the funds at any time, and then they can recommend that grants be made from the fund to qualified nonprofit groups in any amount and at any time in the future--anywhere in the world. Community foundations also work with people to help them implement charitable giving as part of their estate plans--e.g., through a bequest. &nbsp;A charitable foundation is a nonprofit corporation or trust with a principal purpose of making grants to unrelated organizations or institutions or to individuals for scientific, educational, cultural, religious, or other charitable purposes. Most such foundations issue grants from investment proceeds of a permanent endowment, like a university\'s permanent endowment; a minority of foundations are set up to &quot;spend down&quot; the endowment itself, meaning they cease to exist after a certain number of years of grantmaking.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
